Chase Briles Peer Review

What did you like about this website?
I really liked the concept of this site and thought it was really creative. I think something went really wrong with the presentation of the site
on my end. I am not sure if it was the vs.code file that was in or not but, looking at the css it defiently didn't show up corrently on my end.

Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's. E.g.
I couldn't make any real comparisons of the webiste because on my end it was messed up and showing a pretty much bare bones html file with no 
css on it but, I think this is a issue with the repository transfer or somthing cause style sheets and everything are there in the html files.

Which has a better user experience (and why)?
I can't really say due to the answer in number 2.

Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?
Luke's code base was way more mantainable than mine. All the code was nearly organized and had plenty of white space so it was quite easy to 
read and figure out what was going on.

Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories?
The code was well structed and in the right folders, it had plenty of white space and was super easy to read along with the css.
if not, suggest some specific improvements
Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.
I can't exactly say if there were issues or not due to issues with the actual webpage showing up for some reason.
were semantically appropriate elements selected
All elements were appropriate semantically.
is the CSS refactored to limit duplication?
The Css is really refactored to limit duplication and was very easy to read.

Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
I would love to get a link to the site to actually take a look at it! I was pretty bummed that somthing broke on my side.
